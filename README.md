# python vs java
| Topic | Python | Java |
| --- |---| --- |
| First release | February 1991 | January 1996 |
| Philosphy | Code readability<br>Relaxed language<br>Dynamic types| General purpose <br>Strict language<br>Static types|
| Type checking | Runtime - Can lead to errors in production | Compile time |
| Compiled | No | Yes to bytecode .class files |
| Performance | Non optimized non compiled code runs a bit slower than Java | Optimized and compiled byte code runs fast in a Java Virtual Machine |
| Verbose | Very few lines <br> Non verbose | Very verbose language <br> Gives large code base
| Strong communities / libraries | Machine Learning. Tensorflow and PyTorch | Asynchronous programming<br> Natural Language Processing |
| Pros | - Easy to learn <br>- Easy to setup and run | - Runs in a Virtual Machine on most operating systems<br>- Strict and scoped code <br> - Predictable at runtime|
| Used a lot by | Data scientists | Senior developers |
| Popularity | Google reports on search phrases shows that Python is now more popular than Java and utilized a bit more due to Machine Learning capabilities | But Java is still very popular and used in a lot of legacy systems |

## Which should I learn and use?
Both! But begin with Python! :-)
